# File-Transferr

share files from one computer to another

Just one condition, both the devices should be on the same network

to share files, run the sender.py file on the machine which is the sender's 
That will basically start a socket server listening for connections on the host machine

keep note : you'll get a ip address printed on the console on running the sender.py file

then run the complementary receiver.py on the receiver's machine.

you need to give the earlier mentioned ip address and the name of the file to be sent (if the file is in the current directory) or the file path (if file is not current directory)
as respectively.

upon giving the appropriate commands, the file transferr should start.

Enjoy!
